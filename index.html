<p>i don't tweet much</p>
<br>
<p>i 'coded' this website on my own lol</p>
<br>
<p>and without further ado, a poem i didn't write</p>
<p>Wolves</p>
<p>I do not want to be reflective any more<br>
Envying and despising unreflective things<br>
Finding pathos in dogs and undeveloped handwriting<br>
And young girls doing their hair and all the castles of sand<br>
Flushed by the children's bedtime, level with the shore.<br>
<br>
The tide comes in and goes out again, I do not want<br>
To be always stressing either its flux or its permanence,<br> 
I do not want to be a tragic or philosophic chorus<br>
But to keep my eye only on the nearer future<br>
And after that let the sea flow over us.<br>
<br>
Come then all of you, come closer, form a circle,<br> 
Join hands and make believe that joined<br>
Hands will keep away the wolves of water<br>
Who howl along our coast. And be it assumed<br>
That no one hears them among the talk and laughter.<br></p>
